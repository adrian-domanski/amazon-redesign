## Amazon - Spend More Smile Less 🤷
### Buy as many new IPads as you want (Test card included below) 💳

## ℹ️ About 

This is my small version of Amazon v.2.0 made with some Stripe magic for payments, and Firebase (cloud functions, storage and authentication).

I've implemented:
- Login page - you can use example credentials below if you don't want to register
- Firebase for authentication, storing orders, and cloud functions
- Stripe payments

## 💻 What did I use?

* React.js (Vite.js)
* TypeScript
* BEM
* Moment.js
* Axios
* SCSS
* Netlify (Deploy)
* Firebase
* Stripe

## 🧑‍💼 Example credentials
login: test@gmail.com   
password: 123456

## 💵 How to test payment process?
Right now app is in the test mode so you can use these test card data to pay for your products:

#### Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
#### MM/YY: Any date in the future
#### CVC: any 3 digit number

For more information you can check [Stripe's list of cards numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).
